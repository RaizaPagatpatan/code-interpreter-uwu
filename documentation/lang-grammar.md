- all variable names are case-sensitive and starts with letter or an underscore (_) and followed by a letter, underscore or digits.
- every line contains a single statement
- comments starts with sharp sign(#) and it can be placed anywhere in the program

==, <> -> equal, not equal
Logical operators (<BOOL expression><LogicalOperator><BOOL expression>)

OR -> if one of the BOOL expressions evaluates to true, returns true, else false
NOT -> the reverse value of the BOOL value
Unary operator
'+' -> positive
'-' -> negative
